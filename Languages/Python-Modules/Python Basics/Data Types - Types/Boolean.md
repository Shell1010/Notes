# Boolean

This is possibly the most simple data type. A boolean is a type of data that can only be True or False. This is a boolean.

```python
var = True
var = False
```

These two variables are deemed to be a boolean. Generally comparison operators used within if statements return booleans, this determines whether a certain condition is ran. Therefore, booleans are generally one of the most important data types.

```python
var = 15

if var > 7: # If this condition is determined to be true
	print("OK") # This will activate
else: # If the condition is False
	print("FAIL") # This will activate

```
