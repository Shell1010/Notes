# Floats

Similar to [integers](Integers), floats are also numbers, but they are decimal. This here is a float type.

```python
var = 2.5
```

You can do math with floats.

```python
var = 2.5
other_var = 3.1

print(var + other_var) # This will print 5.6
```

Here is the complete list of arithmetic operators within Python.

### [[Arithmetic Operators]]

With floats you can also use [[Comparison operators]] to determine whether a condition is true/false. For example.

```python
var = 2.5

if var < 3:
	print("OK")
else:
	print("Fail")
```

Here is the complete list of comparison operators within Python.

### [[Comparison Operators]]

Mathematical operations/comparison operations between floats and [integers](Intergers) works also.

```python
var = 2.5
other_var = 2
print(var + other_var) # This will print 4.5
```
