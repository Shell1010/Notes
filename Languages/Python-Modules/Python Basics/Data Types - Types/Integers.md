# Integers

This here is an int, shorthand for integer. It is generally used to represent well, integers, another word for numbers.

```

You can do math with integers.

```python
var = 2
other_var = 5

print(var + other_var) # This will print 7

result = var * other_var # This value will be 2x5 = 10

print(result) # This will print 10
```

Here is the complete list of arithmetic operators within Python.

With integers you can also use [[Comparison operators]] to determine whether a condition is true/false. For example.

```python
var = 12

if var >= 18:
	print("You are allowed to drink")
else:
	print("Too young!")
```
