# Data Types

In programming, variables can store a variety of different types of information. They can be numbers, words, lists, in general a lot of different types of information can be stored within a variable. Python has data types built-in which all do different things.

Here are a few:

## [[Strings]]

## [[Boolean]]

## [[Integers]]

## [[Floats]]

## [[Arrays]]

## [[Dictionaries]]

To check what a certain variables data type is you can use the `type()` function.

```python
var = 12
print(type(var)) # This will print <class 'int'> - the integer type. We'll go over classes later on
```
