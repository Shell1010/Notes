# [Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)

Asyncio is a library designed to write concurrent code using a very simple async/await syntax.

It is the foundation for many asynchronous frameworks that provides high-performance networking and webservers. It's often perfectly fit for I/O driven code and high-level code.
