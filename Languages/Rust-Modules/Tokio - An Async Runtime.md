# Tokio

## [Tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/index.html) - An async rust runtime

Tokio is a runtime built for writing mainly reliable networking applications without compromising speed. It is an event driven, non-blocking I/O platform, dedicated for writing asynchronous applications with Rust.

In cargo.toml the easiest way to get started is this. It enables all features of the crate.

```toml
tokio = { version = "*", features = ["full"] }
```
